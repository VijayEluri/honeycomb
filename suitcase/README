1 Introduction
--------------

The ConvertOidBatch tool is made available to our 1.0 customers who
keep ST5800 Object Identifiers (OIDs) in an external location such as
a database or file on the client side, and access their data by
retrieving these OIDs. These stored OIDs will need to be converted to
1.1 format when the customer system is upgraded to 1.1.

2 Installation
--------------

The ConvertOidBatch tool is installed during the upgrade process on
the service node in /usr/local/st5800/bin and can be used directly by
service personnel via the service node (see Usage below). This
approach should be used by Sun Service only, using a list of OIDs
provided by the customer; the customer should not log into the service
node.

The ConvertOidBatch tool can also be installed on a customer machine,
if desired, for the customer to use. It is made available on the
installation/upgrade DVD, and should be installed by Sun Service.

On a Solaris machine:

The SUNWhcsuitcase package can be installed directly from the DVD as
follows:
1. Mount the DVD on the desired machine.
2. pkgadd -d /<dvdpath>/Honeycomb_1.0/Product SUNWhcsuitcase
3. Unmount the DVD.

ConvertOidBatch and its associated files will be installed into
/usr/local/st5800 with subdirectories bin, lib, etc. A different
destination path can be specified if this is not the desired location.


On a Linux or Windows machine:

The SUNWhcsuitcase directory can be copied from the DVD to the desired
location on the client's machine as follows:
1. Mount the DVD on the desired machine.
2. cd <dvdpath>/Honeycomb_1.0/Product/SUNWhcsuitcase/root/usr/local
3. cp -r st5800 <destination>
4. Unmount the DVD

The ConvertOidBatch tool will be located at <destination>/st5800/bin
and can be run from that directory.


3 Usage
-------

The ConvertOidBatch tool reads a list of OIDs (one OID per line of
input) off of stdin, and outputs to stdout.  Usage is:

cat <file of 1.0 OIDs> | ConvertOidBatch [cellid] [options] > <output file>

cellid is 1 by default, and is how the cluster is automatically
configured during a 1.0->1.1 upgrade. There is currently no way to
assign a different cell ID for 1.0->1.1 upgrades. ConvertOidBatch
takes in cellid as an argument in case support for changing the cell
ID of an upgraded 1.0 cluster is implemented.

Possible options:
map : output OIDs in a mapping of 1.0 to 1.1 OIDs (default)
list : output OIDs in a list of 1.1 OIDs
help : print the usage message.

The expected input is a list of 1.0 OIDs, for example:

0100010000687d187111dcae2300e081719ca7000006a00200000000
01000100014f48187811dc9c2100e081719c8f000012310200000000
010001000255fa187711dcbbe300e0817198360000152c0200000000
0100010004cafb187011dc930700e081719c57000002930200000000

The default output is a mapping of 1.0 to 1.1 OIDs, so the customer
can associate the new OIDs with their content in whatever manner they
use:

01000100000fcf18c511dcaf1b00e081719860000008b40200000000 02000147cb00000fcf18c511dcaf1b00e081719860000008b40200000000
01000100000fcf190f11dc935100e081719c4b000014700200000000 02000135e900000fcf190f11dc935100e081719c4b000014700200000000
01000100001a0e18c611dc88d400e0815f5e0e00001ca20200000000 02000114b300001a0e18c611dc88d400e0815f5e0e00001ca20200000000
01000100001ac818e011dcae2300e081719ca7000002a90200000000 02000106a600001ac818e011dcae2300e081719ca7000002a90200000000

If the customer wants a simple list of converted 1.1 OIDs as output,
they can use the list command line option:
cat <input file> | ConvertOidBatch [cellid] list > <output file>

02000147cb00000fcf18c511dcaf1b00e081719860000008b40200000000
02000135e900000fcf190f11dc935100e081719c4b000014700200000000
02000114b300001a0e18c611dc88d400e0815f5e0e00001ca20200000000
02000106a600001ac818e011dcae2300e081719ca7000002a90200000000


4 Limitations
-------------

ConvertOidBatch does not support conversion from 1.1 back to 1.0 OIDs,
only from 1.0 to 1.1. If service personnel needs to perform conversion
from a 1.1 OID back to 1.0 OID for troubleshooting purposes, they may
use the internal-only tool ConvertOid (which only converts one OID at
a time) instead of ConvertOidBatch. ConvertOid is installed with
ConvertOidBatch in the above installation procedures. For ConvertOid
usage, type "ConvertOid help".
