# This script runs CMMVerifier app. 
# It must run on the cluster's internal network, i.e. from the cheat node or one of the cluster nodes.
# Args: 
# (1) number of nodes in the cluster (MUST SPECIFY)
# (2) number of retries before failing if the cluster state is inconsistent (default = 1, 0 = run forever)
# (3) time interval between retries (default = 1 second)
# (4) 'cmm-only' to verify only CMM state (default = verify CMM and nodemgr mailboxes) 
# (5) 'quorum' if the cluster is expected to have quorum
#
NODES=$1
TRIES=$2
INTERVAL=$3
NOMAILBOX=$4
QUORUM=$5

# Defaults: single verification attempt, cluster is expected to have quorum
