# Runs CMM API client, a command-line tool to get cluster view from some node.
# It must run on cluster's internal network, ie from the cheat or one of cluster nodes.
# Supply hostname of cluster node (eg: hcb101) and location of jar files.
# Type "show" to get cluster view, and "quit" to finish. 
# If you get an exception, the target node must be down (not running CMM).
