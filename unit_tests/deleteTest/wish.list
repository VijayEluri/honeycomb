OA UNIT TEST WISHLIST
=====================

+ [dmehra 06/07/06]
  Expand the  OA unit test framework to test more IO exceptions.
  See closed bug 6393135 "OA should handle unexpected exceptions 
  when doing fragment ops and treat them as a single frag error".
  
+ [dmehra 06/07/06]
  Add RemoveTmpFrags ops to the framework. This is required to test
  coming fixes for bugs 6406228, 6416220.

+ [dmehra 06/07/06]
  Port the framework to run on a real cluster. This will require
  writing a new ErrorInjectingFragmentFile and reconfiguring ant
  to build with different sources (eg. real Layout and Disk).
  The win is ability to run all UT scenarios on the cluster.

+ [dmehra/sarahg 06/07/06]
  Sarah's old todo list is here, she will help decipher items:
  https://hc-twiki.sfbay.sun.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OAUnitTests

+ [dmehra 06/07/06]
  Need to look over scenarii/KNOWN_FAILURES, they indicate either
  a problem in UT framework, or potentially an OA bug. Look at the
  testcase files, XXX notes at the top explain the nature of failure.
