Status:
Bugs:
Description:
Test 0
make sure everything works with no failures. Boot the cluster nodes in several 
different orders, and make sure that in each case after all the nodes are up 
they all get traffic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status:
Bugs:
Description:
Though not exclusively switch related, see how the cluster behaves when clients
are attempting to write/read as it's starting up.  It would be nice to 
gracefully deny requests until the cluster is sufficiently ready.  No data
should be corrupted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status:
Bugs:
Description:
Test 1: fail a non-master node; make sure all client nodes still get service 
(possibly after a brief interruption, 10s - 15s). Bring the node back up; make 
sure all nodes are getting traffic (again, possibly after a brief interruption).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status:
Bugs:
Description:
Test 2: fail a master node. Repeat Test 1. The service interruption  may be 
longer (20s - 30s). Bring the node back up; rinse; repeat.

Status:
Bugs:
Description:
Test 3: fail the active switch. Again, make sure all client nodes still get 
service.

Status:
Bugs:
Description:
Test 4
    i) fail a node
   ii) cause a switch failover
  iii) fail the master node
   iv) bring the node from step i up
Do all nodes still get traffic?

There are a couple of shell-scripts in /opt/honeycomb/bin: irules.sh and 
imask.sh. These print the current state of the switch masks and rules in a 
reasonably human-readable form. They're useful if some node is not getting any 
traffic. Also, there are messages in the syslog each time a node comes up or 
goes down, or a switch fails over.

It's probably useful to have a way of telling StoreRetrieve to re-try on 
failure instead of choking. Perhaps print the interval for which it couldn't 
talk to HC.
