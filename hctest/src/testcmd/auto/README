FILES:

    README 		this file, honeycomb test auto-run config
    mkinst_image	builds images, installs, wipes disk, reboots clusters
    run_tests		calls mkinst_image then runs the configged tests
    finish_tests	runs any test-generated scripts for ending tests
    qareport		generates email summarizing test results from dbase

    clusters/	created by person setting up
    build/	created by mkinst_image for putting hc & config in initrd
    run/	created by run_tests for running the tests

To set up auto-run tests:

1.  Mkdir /test

2.  Copy the contents of the honeycomb/test/src/cmd/auto/ directory
    to /test

3.  Make the honeycomb/test/dist/testcmd tree by running ant (no args)
    in honeycomb/test/src/cmd/ and copy honeycomb/test/dist/testcmd to 
    /test on the target machine.

4.  Copy the contents of the honeycomb/test/src/cmd/lib/ directory
    to the equivalent of /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/

5.  Make sure the database named in honeycomb/test/src/cmd/lib/qadb.pm
    is up (my $dbhost = "dbname"), e.g. by '/test/testcmd/bin/qa results'

6.  See mkinst_image to see where the auto-build takes place and
    either make sure the build is set up or adjust the script
    accordingly. Note that mkinst_image allows one to override 
    any of the files created by the auto-build by putting a copy
    in the /test/ directory.

7.  Mkdir /test/clusters and add an executable script file for
    each cluster in the auto-test. See run_tests for details.

8.  If the test for a given cluster involves log analysis, turn
    off log rotation on that cluster's cheat/service node.

9.  Test the setup by executing run_tests.

10.  Configure qareport and test it.

11. Schedule run_tests after the build using 'crontab -e'.

12. Schedule finish_tests if appropriate; see below.

13. Schedule qareport.

NOTES

Any tests can be used; the testcmd/bin/Launch* ones have been tested.
Many of the Launch* scripts create a 'FinishRun' script and run 
indefinitely, so to end them automatically one must run the finish_tests
script that will execute all the /test/run/<cluster>/FinishRun scripts.
Note that the FinishRun scripts can take a while to end client processes
and copy/analyze output and logs. Thus if any tests require FinishRun,
the qareport script should be run 10-30 minutes after finish_tests.

The testcmb/bin/Launch* tests typically copy and analyze the logs from
the cluster cheat/service node and analyze them. The log is rolled over
at the beginning of each run. Automatic log rolling (logrotate) should 
be turned off on clusters that are being tested in this way.
