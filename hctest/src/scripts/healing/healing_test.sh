# For cleanest test, run on empty cluster. 
#
# Test stores X objects using EMI tools,
# then takes a snapshot (must have whitebox pkg!),
# disables a disk and waits for healing to complete,
# verifies against snapshot, and
# does read-back verificatio with EMI tools.
# Then it reenables the disk, waits for heal-back,
# and repeats verification.
#
# TODO: Test needs to wipe the disk before reenabling!
#
# Test duration ~30 min for small data set, ~24 hours for large.
