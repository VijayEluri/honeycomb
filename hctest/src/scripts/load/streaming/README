These tools are used for testing video streaming off Honeycomb cluster,
or in general for streaming performance testing. Tests use WebDAV for puts and gets.

Prerequisites: cluster must be up, HADB must be online (query available),
               cluster should have metadata schema for video demo (mdconfig_video.xml).

Input file WipeOpenSpace.mpg (800MB hi-def video) lives on hclog301.
Copy it, and all these scripts, to a location under /mnt/test on the client before starting test.
Do not copy it to /opt/test because it's on ramdisk, not enough space.

0. mkdir /mnt/test/streamingtest
   scp ./* /mnt/test/streamingtest
   cd /mnt/test/streamingtest
   scp hclog301:/var/log/archive1/keepdata/WideOpenSpace.mpg .

1. ./putvideos.sh devXXX - stores several copies of an 800MB video file to the cluster, using curl.

2. ./queryvideos.sh devXXX - queries for the pathnames of stored videos

3. ./getvideos.sh devXXX - downloads stored videos, using curl.

Edit getonevideo.sh to run in a mode where test fails if streaming rate falls below given minimum.
By default, downloads run to completion, and output the average throughput rate.
Human analysis is necessary to decide whether the test succeeded.

Additional scripts store and retrieve are provided to do the test via Java API instead of WebDAV.
