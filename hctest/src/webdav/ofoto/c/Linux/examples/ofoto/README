This is now set to compile on our old gentoo linux boxes.
The compile environment must be created manually.. note that
this must be re-done after each reboot.

1. Copy hcwin101:/usr/include to /mnt/test and add a symlink
2. Copy  hcwin101:/usr/lib/libc_nonshared.a to /usr/lib

ln -s /mnt/test/usr2/include /usr/include
cp libc_nonshared.a /usr/lib/

The neon & expat .a files were created in the neon & expat subdirs.

Compiled progs are also included.
