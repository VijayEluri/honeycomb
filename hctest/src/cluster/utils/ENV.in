# This file declares the IPs of the servers (public and private) and of the
# test clients.  These lists must be space separated.  These IPs are used
# for running utility programs against all nodes (clients and/or servers)
# and for launching tests against the system.
#
# This file must be customized for each cluster in the places
# where the string CUSTOMIZE appears.
#
# Optionally, there are tests parameters that you can set at the bottom that
# affect the behavior of the tests.
#

SSHARGS="-q -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"


#
# CUSTOMIZE: 
# Edit client hostname in each of the CLIENT IPs
#
# This will change for every cluster as the clients allocated to that 
# cluster change.  By default, we comment out this list so that we don't
# accidentally clobber someone else's tests when using this config file.

#
# CUSTOMIZE: 
# Edit last network number in each of the SERVER PUBLIC IPs
#
# This will change for every cluster as the servers have unique VIPs.
#
# You can avoid setting SERVER_PUBLIC_IPS and just set the
# SERVER_PUBLIC_DATA_VIP value if you have set your
# switch to type znyx.

# CUSTOMIZE:
