# This file declares the IPs of the servers (public and private) and of the
# test clients.  These lists must be space separated.  These IPs are used 
# for running utility programs against all nodes (clients and/or servers)
# and for launching tests against the system.
#
# This file must be customized for each cluster in the places
# where the string CUSTOMIZE appears.
#
# Optionally, there are tests parameters that you can set at the bottom that
# affect the behavior of the tests.
#

#
# CUSTOMIZE: edit network numbers to apply to the cluster nodes and clients
#

BASE_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP="10.7.225"           # will change depending on cluster

BASE_SERVER_PRIVATE_IP="10.123.45"         # shouldn't change


#
# CUSTOMIZE: 
# Edit last network number in each of the CLIENT IPs
#
# This will change for every cluster as the clients allocated to that 
# cluster change.  By default, we comment out this list so that we don't
# accidentally clobber someone else's tests when using this config file.
