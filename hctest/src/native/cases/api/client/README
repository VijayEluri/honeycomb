The two axes of the C api are:

	Blocking ('ez') vs. nonblocking
	NVOA vs. OA

The 1.0 release (defined in client_c's hcclient.h) only covers
the {Blocking, NVOA} quadrant. The tests in this directory include
unused non-blocking (hcnb*.c). hcDelete.c should be hcezDelete.c.

Whether a test is used is determined by inclusion in hctestharness.c's
load_tests() of the registering function, xxxx_load_tests() (first
routine in each test's file).
