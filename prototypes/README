This directory contains a prototype file for each of the source 
file types we plan to use for honeycomb.  When creating a new
source file, use these prototypes for consistency. Before commiting 
the new file into svn execute the following line:
'svn propset  svn:keywords Id <file name>'

Please add a new prototype if one is needed. 

These files were copied with slight modification from
     /ws/on10-gate/usr/src/prototypes

The rules for copyright follow the guidelines in
