contact information at the bottom of this document.
<p>
This SDK allows you to work with data and metadata stored on a 
@HoneycombProductName@. This document assumes you have a basic 
understanding of how the @HoneycombProductName@ uses data and metadata. 
For more information on the @HoneycombProductName@ data and metadata please 
see the section "Configuring Metadata and File System Views" in the
@HoneycombFullProductName@ Administration Guide (below).

The @HoneycombProductName@ client SDK comes with an emulator (OpenEdition) that enables 
you to test client applications without having to connect to a 
@HoneycombProductName@. 
For further documentation on the emulator please refer to
