<h1>@HoneycombProductName@ Client API</h1>


    The @HoneycombProductName@ Client API provides programatic access to a
    @HoneycombProductName@ server to store, retrieve, query and delete object data
    and metadata. Synchronous versions are provided in C and Java
<!--, and
    a non-blocking version is provided in C for use with POSIX
    operations
-->
.


<h3>@HoneycombProductName@ Concepts</h3>

    The @HoneycombProductName@ operates on Object data, which is stored 
    and retrieved in bulk operations, and Metadata, which is structured and
    searchable. Object data streams through the Client Library
    opaquely, and a well-defined data hash (SHA1) is returned for verification
    purposes (see <a
    href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3174.html">RFC 3174</a>). Metadata
    records are constructed and accessed by named fields. The stored
    representation of metadata records on the @HoneycombProductName@ server is not
    exposed to the user, e.g. no hash is returned when storing metadata.
Data and metadata records are both stored using the 
same reliability mechanisms within the server, and metadata record attributes are 
indexed by a search engine for fast searching.

<h3>Metadata Records</h3> 

Structured data can be associated with Object data in the form of
metadata records. Each metadata record applies to one Data Object;
there is a many-to-one relationship between metadata records and Data
Objects. Each metadata record consists of a set of name/value pairs,
where name is a string, and value is typed. The available names and the
the types of their values are enumerated in the Schema.

<h3>@HoneycombProductName@ Object Identifiers (OIDs)</h3> 

When Object/Metadata is stored, or when Metadata is added to an
existing Object, a @OID_BYTE_LENGTH@ byte OID is returned. This OID
is unique on a particular @HoneycombProductName@, and can be used to
retrieve the Object Data or Metadata. OIDs can also be retrieved using
the query operations.

<h3><a name="Delete Semantics">Delete Semantics</a></h3>

Calling delete on an OID deletes the corresponding metadata record
from the @HoneycombProductName@. Object Data is not explicitely deleted.
When an Object's last metadata record is deleted, the Object Data is also deleted. 

<h3><a href="Query.html">Query Syntax</a></h3>

A query mechanism is provided in the @HoneycombProductName@ Client API to find
metadata records matching a <a href="Query.html">query string</a>. For
simple queries, the OIDs of matching metadata records are
returned. A select clause may be supplied, in which case the requested 
Metadata attributes are returned. Note that matches are on a <i>per
metadata record</i> basis, so multiple metadata records for the same
underlying Data Object may be returned. Also, all conditions must be
satisfied inside a single metadata record; (metadata record attributes
are not transitive accross the metadata records for a given Data
Object).


<h3>@HoneycombProductName@ Client/Server Communication</h3>

Both the Java
and C @HoneycombProductName@ clients use the HTTP protocol to communicate
with the server.

    <p>

    The @HoneycombProductName@ Java Client Library gives users a
    platform-independent mechanism to upload data and metadata to
    the @HoneycombProductName@, and to retrieve and query it. The Client Library is
    designed to work with any implementation of J2SE 4.0 or higher
    with HTTP connectivity to the @HoneycombProductName@. Access is
    designed to be high-level and easy to use. Most operations are
    accomplished in a single (synchronous) method call. The Client
    Library can be used directly or embedded in an application.


<!--
<h3>2.1   Interfaces</h3>

    The Java Client API interacts with the @HoneycombProductName@ server entirely
    through an HTTP protocol (see Protocol_Spec.html). The HTTP
    communication layer uses Apache Commons HTTPClient.

    The @HoneycombProductName@ Java Client Library provides the Name Value Object
    Archive as an application access layer that will be appropriate
    for most users. In addition, an "advanced" interface provides a
    mechanism to customize the @HoneycombProductName@ and to serve as a toolkit to
    build new applications.


<h3>2.2 Name Value Object Archive Application Access</h3>

    Most applications will make use of the NameValueObjectArchive
    class. This class ensures that a default metadata entry is created
    for every object stored even if no metadata is explicitly provided
    at store time. All @HoneycombProductName@ references are to NameValueRecord
    OIDs which are returned by store and query operations. At no time
    does the user obtain the underlying data object OID. Data object
    deletion implicitly occurs when all referencing NameValueRecords
    are deleted. Matches for query where clauses must be met by a
    single NameValueRecord, and multiple NameValueRecord OIDs
    referring to the same underlying data object may be returned.

<h3>2.3 Object Archive Programming Toolkit</h3>

    The ObjectArchive class provides a toolkit for functionality that
    is expected to be of general applicability for all @HoneycombProductName@
    applications. In contrast to the NameValueObjectArchive, all OIDs
    refer to the data object. This functionality might be used to
    integrate the @HoneycombProductName@ as a back end into an existing database
    application, for instance. In this case, the data object OIDs
    might be stored and looked up externally.
-->
    
<h3>Best Practices</h3>

    Starting the JVM incurs a performance penalty, but once running,
    a NameValueObjectArchive can be used repeatedly and from multiple
    threads. I/O is synchronous (blocking). HTTP connections are
    pooled for performance. One instance of the NameValueObjectArchive
    should be instantiated per the @HoneycombProductName@ and used for all
    access to that server until exit.

<h3>Java Client Application Deployment</h3>
    Java applications using the @HoneycombProductName@ Java API reference the honeycomb-client.jar
    library. This library must be included in your classpath when running your
    application. Since the @HoneycombProductName@ Java API was designed to run on Java v1.4 it is
    recommended that you run your client applications in a Java v1.4 or higher environment.

<h3>C Client Application Deployment</h3>
    C applications using the @HoneycombProductName@ C API use both honeycomb and cURL 
    libraries. These libraries are different for each supported platform (Windows,
    Linux, Solaris (x86), Solaris (SPARC)) and are located in the c/&lt;OS&gt;/lib
    directory in the SDK.
