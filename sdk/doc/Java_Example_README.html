<h1>@HoneycombFullProductName@ Java Examples</h1>
<p>
Included with the @HoneycombProductName@ SDK are several command line 
example applications that demonstrate the Java API. The example 
applications are located in the SDK under java/examples. These 
example applications are designed to be compiled with Java 1.5 or higher and 
come complete with a build script. The following Java examples are included:
<p>
<strong>StoreFile</strong><br>
Allows you to specify a file from the command line to store on a 
@HoneycombProductName@ as data. Also allows you to specify
 metadata to include with the file.
<a href="../examples/StoreFile.java"><i>view source code</i><a>
<p>
<strong>AddMetadata</strong><br>
Allows you to specify name value pairs from the command line to store on a
@HoneycombProductName@ as a metadata record.
<a href="../examples/AddMetadata.java"><i>view source code</i><a>
</p><p>
<strong>RetrieveData</strong><br>
Allows you to retrieve data from the @HoneycombProductName@ associated with the supplied Object Identifier. 
The data is saved to a file specified on the command line.
<a href="../examples/RetrieveData.java"><i>view source code</i><a>
</p><p>
<strong>RetrieveMetadata</strong><br>
Allows you to retrieve a metadata record from the @HoneycombProductName@ 
associated with the supplied Object Identifier.
The metadata record is printed to standard output.
<a href="../examples/RetrieveMetadata.java"><i>view source code</i><a>
</p><p>
<strong>DeleteRecord</strong><br>
Deletes a Record from the @HoneycombProductName@ 
for an Object Identifier supplied on the command line. If successful returns 
the OID of the deleted object to standard output.
<a href="../examples/DeleteRecord.java"><i>view source code</i><a>
<p>
<strong>Query</strong><br>
Query a @HoneycombProductName@ for specified Metadata. 
The query string is provided on the command line. Query can print 
out the results as a list of name/value pairs or as a list of OIDs. 
Query allows you to specify the maximum number of results returned.
<a href="../examples/Query.java"><i>view source code</i><a>
<p>
<strong>RetrieveSchema</strong><br>
Retrieves the metadata schema from a @HoneycombProductName@ printing 
it to standard output.
<a href="../examples/RetrieveSchema.java"><i>view source code</i><a>
<p>
<h2>How to Build the Example Applications</h2>
The example applications are in the java/examples 
folder in the SDK. To build the example applications execute 
the master_build.sh script for Linux/Solaris or the master_build.bat script 
for Windows. This will build the examples and put them in a jar archive 
located in java/lib/ (note that this has already been done for you, so
it isn't necessary unless you want to change the programs and recompile).
The compile warning, "Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations"
can be ignored - it is a Java 1.5 artifact of using a HashMap to store a
variety of object types.
<p>
<h2>How to run the Example Applications</h2>
Once you have built the example applications go to the 
java/examples/build folder and execute the jar files:
<p>
	java -jar &lt;Jar File Name&gt; &lt;arguments&gt;
<p>
The examples depend on Getopt.jar and honeycomb-client.jar. 
These files must be in the same directory as the example jar 
files in order for them to run.
<p>
<h2>About the Example Application Source Code</h2>
The example applications are simple and all
follow the same basic pattern. First, Commandline.parse 
is called to parse the argument list. Next, the appropriate
method in in the NameValueObjectArchive class is called to 
communicate with the  @HoneycombProductName@.
Finally, output is delivered back to either standard output, 
a file, or both. Please refer to the comments in the sample 
code for further details.
