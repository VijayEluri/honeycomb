<h1>Query</h1>

The Java and C APIs both have a Query mechanism that passes a query string to 
the @HoneycombFullProductName@ and gets back results. 

<h2>Operation</h2>

The query format looks a lot like the Boolean expression part of an
SQL query. The two main differences are that @HoneycombProductName@ queries do not
contain embedded subqueries, and the only "columns" that are available
are the attributes defined in the @HoneycombProductName@ schema. Many features of
the underlying metadata database's own query language may be used in
queries. There is a recommended subset of queries, however, that is
most likely to be portable from the @HoneycombProductName@ emulator to a live
@HoneycombProductName@ (the server uses HADB for its query engine, 
whereas the emulator uses Derby).

<h2>Literal Format</h2>
Literals can occur in several formats:
<br>
Numeric literals (e.g. <code>45,-1, 3.14, 5.2E10</code>)
<br>
String literals (e.g. <code>'The Lighter Side'</code>). String literals are surrounded by single 
quotes, <code>'</code>.You may embed single quote
<code>'</code> 
characters in a query by doubling them: <code>'Susan''s House'</code>.

<h2>Attribute Format</h2>

Any string in double quotes (e.g. <code>"filename"</code>) and any
dotted string (e.g. <code>mp3.title</code>) will automatically treated
as an attribute. The double quotes may optionally be omitted as long
as the attribute does not match an SQL reserved word in any of our
underlying metadata databases. Some SQL reserved words (such as
<code>SELECT</code> or <code>CREATE</code>) are forbidden from occurring in queries. 

<p>Attribute names must appear in the current @HoneycombProductName@ schema in
order to be used in a query. This is because we have to be able to
derive the proper type information about each attribute in order to
build the query.

<h2>Supported expression types</h2>

The following expression types are explicitly supported in the @HoneycombProductName@ Release 1.0:
<ul>
<li>Boolean operations: <code>expr1 OP expr2</code>, where <code>OP</code>
is one of <code>=</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>.
<br>The Boolean operations can compare any two expressions,
for example two attribute values, or one attribute value and one
literal value. The two values must be of compatible types. For
example, a <code>&lt;</code> comparison may not be used between a numeric literal
value and a string-valued attribute. Note that <code>&lt;&gt;</code> and <code>!=</code> are
synonyms.</li>
<li>The concatenation operator,  <code>expr1 || expr2</code></li>
<li>Use of parentheses to indicate precedence of evaluation.</li>
<li><code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>, and <code>NOT</code>.</li>
<li><code>Expr1 [NOT] LIKE expr2 [{ESCAPE expr3}]</code>
<br>Attempts to match a character expression to a character pattern, which
is a character string that includes one or more wildcards. <code>%</code> matches
any number (zero or more) of characters in the corresponding position
in expr1. <code>_</code> matches one character in the corresponding position in
expr1. Any other character matches only that character in the
corresponding position in the character expression. To treat either <code>%</code>
or _ as constant characters, escape that character with an optional
escape character, which you specify in expr3.</li>

<li>The following JDBC function escapes have been tested and are supported:  
<ul>
<li><code>{fn UCASE(string)}</code> to convert a string to uppercase</li>
<li><code>{fn LCASE(string)}</code> to convert a string to lowercase</li>
<li><code>{fn ABS(value)}</code> to take the absolute value of a numeric expression.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>What is not supported in Release 1.0</h2>

The following query forms may work but have not been fully tested or
validated. These operations are, however, a useful guide to those
query capabilities that should eventually function identically between
the @HoneycombProductName@ and emulator.

<ul>
<li>Queries that contain Java Unicode values using the syntax <code>\uXXXX.</code></li>
<li><code>Expr1 BETWEEN expr2 AND expr3</code></li>
<li><code>Expr [NOT] IN (valueslist)</code></li>
<li>Other  JDBC function escapes as described in Appendix B of the JDBC Specification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples of Supported Query Expressions</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>{fn LCASE(mp3.artist)} LIKE '%floyd%' AND system.object_size &gt; 2000000</code></li>
<li><code>(object_size &lt; 200) OR  "Collation" = en-US'</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>Reserved Words</h2>
 All of the words on either the HADB or Derby SQL Reserved Words lists are reserved and cannot be used as Attribute names unless the Attribute name is enclosed in double quotes. 

<h2>Allowed Query Terms</h2>
Some reserved words are allowed and necessary in queries, such as <code>LIKE</code>. These words are expected to be used in generating queries. 
<p>
The following reserved words are allowed: 
<br>
<code>
ABS, ABSOLUTE, AFTER, AND, AS, ASCII, AT, BEFORE, BETWEEN, BINARY, BIT, BIT_LENGTH, BOOLEAN, BOTH, CASE, CAST, CHAR, CHARACTER, CHARACTER_LENGTH, CHAR_LENGTH, COALESCE, COLLATE, COLLATION, CONTAINS,COUNT, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, DATE, DAY, DEC,DECIMAL, DOUBLE, ELSE, ELSEIF, END, ESCAPE, EXISTS, EXIT, EXPAND,EXTRACT, FALSE, FIRST, FOR, FROM, HOUR, IF, IN, INT, INTEGER, INTERVAL,IS, LCASE, LEADING, LEFT, LIKE, LOWER, MATCH, MAX, MIN, MINUTE, MONTH,NCHAR, NO, NOT, NULL, NUMERIC, OCTET_LENGTH, OF, R, PAD, PI,POSITION, REAL, RIGHT, RTRIM, SECOND, SIZE, SMALLINT, SUBSTRING, THEN,TIME, TIMESTAMP, TIMEZONE_HOUR, TIMEZONE_MINUTE, TO, TRAILING, TRIM,TRUE, UCASE, UNKNOWN, UPPER, VARBINARY, VARCHAR, VARYING, WHEN,WHENEVER, YEAR, ZONE.

</code>

<h2>Forbidden Words in Queries</h2>
 Some reserved words are forbidden to be used in queries. such as <code>SELECT</code> and <code>ORDER BY</code> or <code>stringattribute</code>. The StorageTek 5800 server will immediately raise an exception when one of the forbidden reserved words is used in a query. 
<p>
The following reserved words are forbidden:
<p>
<code>
 ACTION,ADD, ALL, ALLOCATE, ALTER, ANY, APPLICATION, ARE, AREA, ASC, ASSERTION, ATOMIC, AUTHORIZATION, AVG, BEGIN, BY, CALL, CASCADE, CASCADED, CATALOG, CHECK, CLOSE, COLUMN, COMMIT, COMPRESS, CONNECT, CONNECTION, CONSTRAINT, CONSTRAINTS, CONTINUE, CONVERT, CORRESPONDING, CREATE, CROSS, CURRENT, CURRENT_PATH, CURRENT_SCHEMA, CURRENT_SCHEMAID, CURRENT_USER, CURRENT_USERID, CURSOR, DATA, DEALLOCATE, DECLARE, DEFAULT, DEFERRABLE, DEFERRED, DELETE, DESC, DESCRIBE, DESCRIPTOR, DETERMINISTIC, DIAGNOSTICS, DIRECTORY, DISCONNECT, DISTINCT, DO, DOMAIN, DOUBLEATTRIBUTE, DROP, EACH, EXCEPT, EXCEPTION, EXEC, EXECUTE, EXTERNAL, FETCH, FLOAT, FOREIGN, FOUND, FULL, FUNCTION, GET, GLOBAL, GO, GOTO, GRANT, GROUP, HANDLER, HAVING, IDENTITY, IMMEDIATE, INDEX, INDEXED, INDICATOR, INITIALLY, INNER, INOUT, INPUT, INSENSITIVE, INSERT, INTERSECT, INTO, ISOLATION, JOIN, KEY, LANGUAGE, LAST, LEAVE, LEVEL, LOCAL, LONGATTRIBUTE, LOOP, MODIFIES, MODULE, NAMES, NATIONAL, NATURAL, NEXT, NULLIF, ON, ONLY, OPEN, OPTION, ORDER, OUT, OUTER, OUTPUT, OVERLAPS, OWNER, PARTIAL, PATH, PRECISION, PREPARE, PRESERVE, PRIMARY, PRIOR, PRIVILEGES, PROCEDURE, PUBLIC, READ, READS, REFERENCES, RELATIVE, REPEAT, RESIGNAL, RESTRICT, RETURN, RETURNS, REVOKE, ROLLBACK, ROUTINE, ROW, ROWS, SCHEMA, SCROLL, SECTION, SELECT, SEQ, SEQUENCE, SESSION, SESSION_USER, SESSION_USERID, SET, SIGNAL, SOME, SPACE, SPECIFIC, SQL, SQLCODE, SQLERROR, SQLEXCEPTION, SQLSTATE, SQLWARNING, STATEMENT, STRINGATTRIBUTE, SUM, SYSACC, SYSHGH, SYSLNK, SYSNIX, SYSTBLDEF, SYSTBLDSC, SYSTBT, SYSTBTATT, SYSTBTDEF, SYSUSR, SYSTEM_USER, SYSVIW, SYSVIWCOL, TABLE, TABLETYPE, TEMPORARY, TRANSACTION, TRANSLATE, TRANSLATION, TRIGGER, UNDO, UNION, UNIQUE, UNTIL, UPDATE, USAGE, USER, USING, VALUE, VALUES, VIEW, WHERE, WHILE, WITH, WORK, WRITE, ALLSCHEMAS, ALLTABLES, ALLVIEWS, ALLVIEWTEXTS, ALLCOLUMNS, ALLINDEXES, ALLINDEXCOLS, ALLUSERS, ALLTBTS, TABLEPRIVILEGES, TBTPRIVILEGES, MYSCHEMAS, MYTABLES, MYTBTS, MYVIEWS, SCHEMAVIEWS, DUAL, SCHEMAPRIVILEGES, SCHEMATABLES, STATISTICS, USRTBL, STRINGTABLE, LONGTABLE, DOUBLETABLE.
