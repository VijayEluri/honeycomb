<h1>@HoneycombFullProductName@ Semantics Overview</h1>
<p><h2>Data and Metadata</h2>
The @HoneycombProductName@  stores two types of data: 
arbitrary Object Data, and structured metadata records.
Every metadata record is associated with exactly one Data Object. 
Every Data Object has at least one metadata record.
A unique Object Identifier (OID) is returned when a metadata record is stored, 
and can later be used to retrieve the metadata record or its Object Data.
In addition, metadata records and OID's can be retrieved by queries.

<p>OID <----> Metadata Record ----> Object Data
<p>There are two types of metadata, system metadata and extended metadata. 
The names and types of system metadata are predefined and cannot be overridden by the user.
</p>

<p><h2>Metadata Schema</h2>
An extended metadata record consists of a set of attributes. 
The set of possible attributes is defined by the schema. 
There is only one schema per @HoneycombProductName@. 
The emulator loads its schema from an XML file. 
The metadata_merge_config utility can be used to extend the 
default schema, generating a new XML file read by the @HoneycombProductName@ emulator. 
See <a href="../emulator/Emulator_Setup_and_Configuration.html">
Emulator Setup and Configuration</a> for more information.
</p>

<p><h2>Attributes</h2>
There are four valid types you can use when specifying attributes in a schema. 
The following table shows the valid data types:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Valid Types</td><td> 		Description</td></tr> 
<tr><td colspan="2">--------------------------------------------------------------------</td></tr>
<tr><td>Double</td><td>			64-bit floating point number</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Long</td><td> 			64-bit integer</td></tr> 
<tr><td>String </td><td>		Character string, no size limit (512-byte limit on queryable length)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Byte </td><td>			8 bit value (Octet)</td></tr>
</table>

<p><h2>Namespace</h2>
A namespace is a container that holds a set of typed attribute names. 
Every typed attribute name belongs to a namespace. 
Attribute names must be unique within a given namespace. Attributes in a namespace are referenced with the syntax &lt;Namespace&gt;.&lt;Attribute&gt;
</p>
