NAME
       SetRetentionTime - set a retention time on a previously 
       stored object

SYNOPSIS
       java SetRetentionTime <IP | HOST> <OID> <RETENTION_TIME_STRING> [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Set a retention time on a stored object. RETENTION_TIME_STRING 
       describes the retention time to be placed against the object, and 
       must be of the format:

       MMM dd HH:mm:ss z yyyy
       "Nov 20 16:42:10 PST 2008"

       Alternately, the string "infinite" can be given for
       RETENTION_TIME_STRING in order to set a retention time that
       never expires and prevent deletion of the object. Once this
       has been set, the object can subsequently be deleted by
       updating its retention time with a future time which will
       expire.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              print this message

EXAMPLES
       java SetRetentionTime server @SampleOID@ "Nov 20 16:42:10 PST 2008"
       java SetRetentionTime server @SampleOID@ infinite
