This directory contains the source code for the @HoneycombProductName@ C client examples.  A makefile is include which by default will build all the examples.  To build individual examples type "make <example name>".  For example, "make StoreFile" will just build the StoreFile example.  Examples are built in an <OS>/build directory that is created at build time.
