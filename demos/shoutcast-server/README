                    Shoutcast server demo for Honeycomb

**********************************************************************

This directory contains the shoutcast server demo for honeycomb (killer
release).

This README file contains the instructions to build and run it.

I- BUILD
--------

Simply go to the <WS>/demos/shoutcast-server directory and enter :
make tar

You will get a shoutcast-demo.tgz file that contains all the needed files.

II- INSTALL AND RUN
-------------------

1. Untar the shoutcast-demo.tgz file somewhere (let's say <DIR>).

2. Start the shoutcast server :
cd <DIR>/shoutcast/bin
./sc_serv > /tmp/SHOUTCAST_LOG 2>&1 &

IMPORTANT ! You actually have to cd to the bin directory, because the
sc_serv binary looks for the configuration file in the working directory.

3. Start the honeycomb D.J. that reads MP3s from the cluster and forwards
them to the server :
<DIR>/run_hcshout.sh <IP of the honeycomb cluster>

4. Take any streaming capable client (such as XMMS) and read the stream
from the IP of the machine where the sc_serv server has been started (port
8000)

For XMMS :
i- right click on the main XMMS window ;
ii- select Play Location ;
iii- enter <IP of the machine>:8000

Enjoy !!
