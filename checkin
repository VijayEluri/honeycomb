6689138 fixed

Our eccentric release mechanism involves first doing the Sacha build (running a sh script which is a link to another sh script which runs a perl script), which constructs a pseudo-tag data base then copies the checkout and the AUTOBUILT directory to /export/home/hcbuild/major.minor. Unfortunately, the Open Edition target is not expecting this new top level directory, and the ant regexp (for the copyright) goes crazy. Either it can't handle the 80,000 files, or the ramdisk image causes its head to explode. In either case, add AUTOBUILT from the copy target; it's full off all sorts of build logs and other junk.
