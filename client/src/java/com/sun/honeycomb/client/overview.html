This document is the API specification for the @HoneycombFullProductName@ 
Java client library.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

The @HoneycombProductName@ client library provides a simple way of communicating 
with the @HoneycombProductName@ servers. 
It provides programmatic access to the @HoneycombProductName@ server using 
an HTTP-based network protocol.

<!-- Most applications can be implemented using a handful of these classes, 
but access to "expert" features is also provided. -->

<h3>Basic Concepts and Key Classes</h3>

<!--
The root of the Honeycomb client API is the <code>ObjectArchive</code> class, which 
represents a connection to a single Honeycomb cluster. All operations are initiated 
by invoking methods on an <code>ObjectArchive</code> instance after initializing it 
with the address of a cluster, and the fact that a cluster of machines, rather than 
a single server, is handling the requests is transparent to the application programmer.
<p>
An <code>ObjectArchive</code> uses instances of the <code>ObjectIdentifier</code> 
class to uniquely identify stored objects. That is, there is a one-to-one 
correspondence between <code>ObjectIdentifers</code> and Honeycomb objects. 
<code>ObjectIdentifers</code> are created by the cluster at store time and 
returned to the client. These identifiers can be serialized and stored
 externally as byte arrays or strings to be reconstituted later, or can
 be discarded and retrieved later using metadata queries. 
<p>
Most applications will make use of an <code>ObjectArchive</code> subclass 
called <code>NameValueObjectArchive</code>. This class hides some of the 
more advances details of Honeycomb metadata and makes it easy to implement 
applications. When using <code>NameValueObjectArchive</code>, all metadata 
queries are executed against Honeycomb's user-configurable index of name-value
 pair lists. This class also ensures that a metadata entry is created for 
every object stored even if no metadata is provided at store time (see 
<a href="#AdvancedConcepts">Advanced Concepts and Classes</a> for details).
<p>
-->
The <a href="com/sun/honeycomb/client/NameValueObjectArchive.html"<code>
NameValueObjectArchive</code></a> is the main entry for programmatic access 
to the @HoneycombProductName@ server. An instance of this class functions 
as a proxy for the @HoneycombProductName@ server. Instantiation incurs some 
overhead in establishing communication, so reusing a single instance is the 
recommended practice. Multithreading is supported with the same instance.
The <code>NameValueObjectArchive</code> class provides methods to store,
retrieve, query and delete data and metadata records.

<p>
Metadata is accessed through two classes that represent structured data: 
<a href="com/sun/honeycomb/client/SystemRecord.html">
<code>SystemRecord</code></a> and 
<a href="com/sun/honeycomb/client/NameValueRecord.html">
<code>NameValueRecord</code></a>. These classes
 represent @HoneycombProductName@ metadata entries. 
Every stored object has at least one corresponding <code>NameValueRecord</code> 
that contains the metadata attributes, and each 
<code>NameValueRecord</code> has a reference to its <code>SystemRecord</code>, 
which contains built-in system attributes such as object size and creation 
time.
<p>
The results of 
a @HoneycombProductName@ metadata query are returned using instances of the 
<code>QueryResultSet</code> class which the application can step through to 
retrieve metadata or <code>ObjectIdentifier</code>s.

<!--
<h3>@HoneycombProductName@ Semantics</h3>

The @HoneycombProductName@ distinguishes between two types of data: 
Object data and metadata records. Object data is opaque to 
the @HoneycombProductName@ and may be large. Metadata records are 
used to associate structured data with Object data. There are one or more 
metadata records for each unstructured Data Object. An <code>ObjectIdentifer</code> 
returned to the client at store time corresponds to a
metadata record, and can be used to retrieve the metadata record or the underlying 
Object data. If only Object data (and no metadata) is provided during a store 
operation, an empty metadata record is implicitly created.
-->

<p>
<!--
In addition to distinguishing between object types, a Honeycomb cluster 
maintains a number of different metadata caches, or indexes, each for 
a specific purpose. Most applications make use only of the configurable 
name-value cache, but some advances users may want to access the others 
directly. <code>ObjectArchive</code> provides methods to perform metadata 
stores and searches using a specific cache. The caches currently supported 
are System, for built-in attributes; Name-Value, for extended attributes; 
and Directory, for information specific to hierarchical file protocols 
like NFS. Access to these caches allows the creation of cross-cache 
metadata entries, for example adding name-value entries for files written 
through NFS based on metadata extracted from the content of those files. 
These name-value entries could then be used in the creation of virtual 
NFS views based on metadata queries.
<p>
Each metadata cache in the cluster is represented on the client by an 
implementation of the <code>MetadataCache</code> interface, and each 
<code>MetadataCache</code> produces instances of a corresponding 
<code>MetadataRecord</code> class. Each cache class can also vend 
its server-side runtime configuration as an instance of a specific 
<code>CacheConfiguration</code> class, allowing for the dynamic 
discovery of cluster configuration such as the attributes supported 
by the extended name-value cache.
