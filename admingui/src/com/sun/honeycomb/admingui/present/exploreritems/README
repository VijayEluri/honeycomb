This folder contains classes for explorer items that have children.  Each explorer item
with children should populate those children in the populateChildren class.
It should also define its own properties in the call to super() in the constructor.

If any children of an item itself has children, that child should have its own class
and populate its children in populateChildren.

If any child of an item does not have children, that child can be created using
the ExplorerItem class in the populateChildren method of its parent.  
A derived class for the child is not necessary.
