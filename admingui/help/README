To update the help system, you need to JAR the online help system
and copy it to external/dist/lib/st5800-help.jar

To jar the file, cd to the directory that contains the "en" directory, then run
    jar cvf st5800-help.jar en/*

The compression should be turned on by default.

You also need to copy en/hc_hlp.jhm to the admingui/help directory.
Then run 'ant help.convert' (which calls "admingui/bin/jhm2java.pl") - this will take
the content of hc_hlp.jhm and convert it into a java file called HelpFileMapping.java. 
The resultant java file will be moved into the com/sun/honeycomb/admingui/present directory.
This file contains the map of the help page keys so we know
which page to show when user launches the online help system.
