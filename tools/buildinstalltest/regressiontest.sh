# Only edit this script in the repository

#
# usage: regression cluster [svnroot version]
#
# example: regressiontest.sh dev331 /export/home/sarahg/svn/build/automated-build-2005-09-14-1548 automated-build-2005-09-14-1548
#
# Notes:
#
# This script must be able to find an ssh key to access the cluster.
# It will look in the workspace if possible, and copy it to a tmp location
# with the right perms.
#
# The cheat node must have the /utils/ENV file configured correctly
