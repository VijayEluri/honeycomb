When updating this readme, please copy it as follows:

  scp README root@subversion:/usr/local/svnrepos/honeycomb/hooks/README

Don't modify these scripts directly on the subversion server...
First, check the change in to the appropriate repository and then
copy that version here so it has the updated SVN header.  This makes
tracking changes to these scripts a lot more managable.  See the comments
in the files for more info on how to copy them to the right place.

For /usr/local/svnrepos/docs/hooks/*, update <docsrepo>/tools/subversion
For /usr/local/svnrepos/honeycomb/hooks/*, update <honeycombrepo>/tools/subversion
For /usr/local/svnrepos/platform/hooks/*, update <honeycombrepo>/tools/subversion/*-platform

(Note the reason the platform hooks are in the honeycomb repository
is that checking out the platform repository is a pain because it is
huge, and it is easier to just use the honeycomb repository for this.
We can change this if we want to be more consistent.)


To test post-commit, you can run, but note that this will send a new diff
mail for this "test" diff, which isn't a big deal. 

[root@subversion hooks]# ./post-commit /usr/local/svnrepos/honeycomb 7184


Occasionally, we have to update the bt-cli bits...

/usr/local/bt-client/WEB-INF copied from /usr/dist/share/bt2cli

To test out bt-cli access outside of the commit scripts, do this:

/usr/local/bt-client/bt-cli print cr -U honeycomb -pFile /usr/local/bt-client/passwd.txt -id 6209241

/usr/local/bt-client/bt-cli print cr -U honeycomb -pFile /usr/local/bt-client/passwd.txt -s ./identity.xsl -o foo.out -id 6209241


You can use this bugid for checkins:
