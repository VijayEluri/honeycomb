DATABASE SETUP
--------------

As root:

For mysql setup:

$ mysqladmin create flamebox
$ mysql
mysql> use flamebox;
mysql> grant all privileges on flamebox.* to nobody@localhost;
mysql> exit;
$

Now, you can run maketables.sh to create the tables.
$ $TARGET/bin/maketables.sh


WEBSERVER SETUP
---------------

Flamebox cgi scripts are run by your Apache Web Server.
You need to configure Apache to allow execution of CGI
scripts in $TARGET/bin. Apache also needs access to a
few directories listed below.

1) $TARGET/html/task_img is a directory to store the task images (the vertical text).
This directory must be accessible through your web server. 
Make sure this directory is writable by the uid your web server is going to use 
to run the flambox cgi scripts.

Edit $TARGET/config/params.pl accordingly:

$imagepath = "/var/www/flamebox/html/task_img";
$imageurl = "http://mywebserver/flamebox/task_img";

2) $TARGET/html/logs is a directory to store the logs (the output of each run).
Make sure this directory is writable by the uid your web server 
is going to use to run the flamebox cgi scripts (note that this 
directory need not be accessible by your web server). 

Edit $TARGET/config/params.pl accordingly:

$logpath = "/var/www/flamebox/html/logs";

Edit your apache configuration:

#
# Flamebox
#
Alias /flamebox "/var/www/flamebox/html/"

<Directory "/var/www/flamebox/html">
   DirectoryIndex query.html
</Directory>

ScriptAlias /fbox-cgi/ /var/www/flamebox/bin/

<Directory "/var/www/flamebox/bin">
   Options +ExecCGI
   AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
</Directory>
