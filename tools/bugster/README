The bugsbydate scripts was copied from the Solaris Nevada gate:
   /ws/onnv-gate/public/gate/bin/
and modified for honeycomb.  They must run on hc-dev3. 
sql access isn't supported on x86 Solaris at this time.

Currently, they live on hc-dev3:/export/home/bugster/bugscripts
and are kicked off via a cron script every day.
The cron script is currently run as user sarahg,
since I didn't want to run as root if it didn't have
to.  See crontab.hc-dev3

I believe the SPARC platform is required to run this.

The passwd file is in bugaccess.sh.
The Powers That Be don't like random folks
running sql queries against their DB, so see sarahg
if you have a query need.  

For testing purposes, edit bugscommon.sh to use the 

 TARGETBTDB=$TESTDB

For production data, use this

 TARGETBTDB=$PRODUCTIONDB

Output is in /export/home/bugster/dailystats


How to push new bits:
---------------------
NOTE: you can move the target directory, but you must update cron to point
to the new dir and make sure bugaccess.sh exists in the new dir

* scp -r tools/bugster username@hc-dev3:/export/home/bugster/bugscripts
(dir is currently owned by sarahg)


To Update for a New Release:
----------------------------
* change awk/awkcurfilter for right regexp
* bugscommon.sh TYPECUR, TYPENEXT, TYPEFUTURE should be adjusted
* Manually do first run to have something to diff against:

cd /export/home/bugster/dailystats/
rm latest
mv currdate currdate.orig
/usr/local/bugster/cronbugs.sh
-> this will get an error: /export/home/bugster/bugscripts/cronbugs.sh:
/export/home/bugster/dailystats/latest/lastcompare/dailybugactivitysummary.out:
cannot create
mv currdate currdate.fake
ln -s /export/home/bugster/dailystats/currdate.fake latest
/usr/local/bugster/cronbugs.sh

Then you'll have an empty diff in the currdate directory, but the next
one will have diffs for the remainder of the day to the next.  Things
will be back on track on the 2nd day.
