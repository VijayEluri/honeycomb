# File format:
# OperationName FileSize(bytes) Num ops/sec Num bytes/s(or KB/s or MB/s)
# For queries, the metric is results/sec
#
# The expected performance numbers were generated by
# running the test on current trunk 5 times and deducing limits.
# Limits are set at a safe minimum value to reduce false positives, 
# so failure of the test will indicate a real problem. 
#
# The comparison logic has 5% margin of error (TOLERANCE in regression_test.sh)
