/**
 * A very simple Timeout class. Note that this class relies on the system
 * clock and any substantial changes to the clock between calls to arm() and
 * hasRemaining() or hasExpired() will cause unreliable results.
 *<br><br>
 For instance,
 *
 * <code>
 * Timeout t = new Timeout (60*1000);
 * t.arm();
 * doSomething();
 * if (t.hasExpired()) {
 *   throw new RuntimeException ("timeout expired");
 * }
 * </code>
 *
 * will throw if the system clock is advanced 2 hours while executing
 * doSomething().
