                             HoneyComb project
                                     
                      Cluster Management source code

COMPILATION
-----------

Here are the instructions to compile the source :

1. Generate the configure script
   Run the following commands :
   > aclocal
   > autoconf
   > autoheader
   > automake --foreign -a -c

2. To generate the Makefiles, run
   > ./configure

   configure can take some optionnal parameters. Run ./configure --help to
   have a list

   The main one is --prefix which specifies in which directory the binaries
   should be installed (see step 4.). For example, if you want to install
   in /opt/CM, run :
   ./configure --prefix=/opt/CM

3. To build, run :
   > make

4. To install the product, run :
   > make install
   
If you want to distribute a tarball containing the CM source, enter :
> make dist

It creates a file hccm-<version>.tar.gz

CONFIGURATION
-------------

To get honeycomb configured, you simply have to set up syslog.

All the traces coming from the management will be sent to syslog under the
facility local0.
The used levels are : notice, error and debug.

Here is an example of an entry in syslog.conf file :

local0.*	/var/log/honeycomb.log

Edit your /etc/syslog.conf file (or the equivalent) and restart your syslog
daemon.

NOTE : you can specify at the daemon level if the debug traces should be
generated or not. To run the daemons (hccmmd and hcnmd) with debug traces,
run them with the -d switch.

EXECUTION
---------

To start honeycomb, simply use the script in :
<prefix>/etc/init.d/honeycomb start
(by default, <prefix> is /opt/CM)

This will launch the CMM, the node manager and ask the node manager to
start all the services

You can use the same script to stop / restart the honeycomb node.
